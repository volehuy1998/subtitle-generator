## Sprint L1: Foundation (2026-03-16)

**Goal:** Set up Lumen Docker profile, test infrastructure, and initial test suite.

**Delivered:**
- `docker-compose.yml` — added `lumen` profile on port 8002 with `PRELOAD_MODEL=base`
- `tests/test_lumen/` — test directory with conftest.py fixtures
- `tests/test_lumen/test_upload_resilience.py` — 17 tests covering:
  - Upload validation (no file, empty, corrupt, wrong extension, Unicode filename)
  - Output format validation (SRT, VTT, JSON, invalid model)
  - All 5 model sizes accepted
  - 13 endpoint availability checks (health, metrics, status, docs, openapi, etc.)
- `docs/lumen/SPRINT_LOG.md` — this file

**Tests added:** 17
**Running total:** 1328 + 17 = 1345
